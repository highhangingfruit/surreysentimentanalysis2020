Just the tip of the iceberg for the neglect of COVID-19 at Central City Mall,52,floylw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/floylw/just_the_tip_of_the_iceberg_for_the_neglect_of/,19,1584708407.0,"For anybody who lives in Surrey, you know the Central City mall. Campus of SFU, typical mall food, and a few stores we like to visit. This post is about the letters that that have been sent out to the managers of the stores within the mall, by the mall. 

Copies of ALL of the letters sent out to store managers can be found at  https://m.imgur.com/a/I0pyrU2

Let's start by explaining that they are aware of a confirmed case of an employee of the mall. We can now point out that they have sent out letters to address this issue without doing anything about it. They claim that they will have better sanitization however that has yet to be seen. The food court bathrooms still have blood in the stalls, there was a needle in the Blendz bathroom on Wednesday. The gym and kids play area are JUST closing down now? Have they even been following this virus?

My question is, why the heck are they open?? Is a mall a necessity? Why haven't they closed down? Obviously this one employee was in contact with all of their co-workers, all of them have been wherever throughout the mall and their co-workers are still working at the mall and now have the ability to continue the spread! Surrey, BC is going to be the next Lombardy, Italy due to this mall. 
For those of you who don't know, this is the leading city of cases and deaths thus far from COVID-19 with approximately 75% of the fatalities of Italy and it's due to their IGNORANCE and NEGLIGENCE (and probably a bit of their age). 

How can we fix this? How do we make it so that Surrey isn't the new epicenter of this virus? How do we make Central City mall understand these repercussions and shut down the mall? 

Please spread awareness and share.",2020-03-20 05:46:47

Doug doin doug.

Pettigrew havent heard shit since the election. Complained about trees gettin cut. Left the coalition

Hundial apparently tryna clean up politics in surrey. But also airin all the dirty laundry of the coalition. Turned into full on rcmp supporter. Seems shady to go from running on city police promise and become a full on rcmp supporter. Left the coalition

Locke didnt support the budget for police. Thats about it. Havent heard much of her. Left the coalition

Annis said she wanted to set up some kinda info center to keep youth outta gangs and nothing done yet. Has some issues with the budget but apparently backs city police. Expected more. Shes in surrey first

Patton lives in white rock. Complains about being left out of the police talks. ??? Thats it. Why we payin this bitch?

Nagra lives in delta. Wants to allow more private liq stores. Even wanted to allow them to be opened in noncommercial areas... cuz itll create jobs? Wtf Lol so will dispensaries buddy (and promote outsiders to visit surrey). He is also fightin for truck parking

Elford supported city police... and thats pretty much it. Said people were mean at a council meeting. Honestly expected more from this dude

Guerra supported rcmp and said ppl were mean at the council meeting. Seriously. Forgot shes even on the council

But for some reason they all voted together on shit like banning people from sleeping in vans overnight and allowing more liq stores AND banning cannabis stores.

Dougs doug we knew that goin in to this election but all these councillors leaving the coalition for policing but yet opposing cannabis and support allowing more alcohol stores. Wtf??

The fuck is goin on here???

I'm a huge comedy fan! And I feel like the diversity that Surrey offers, we could have a wonderful and unique comedy scene.

I have the resources and can set up a night twice a week or even once a month for amateurs and I'd be willing to pay professionals to come perform here in Surrey.

It would be free, but a two drink minimum...

Please let me know if you guys would be interested and if there would be people willing to perform/try stand up.

I'm posting this here and in r/vancouver hoping someone recognizes the description and unique shirt. Just pass on the message for us!

My wife, youngest daughter, and I made a trip from our home in the Okanagan down to YVR yesterday to pick up live cargo. On our way back, we detoured into Surrey to grab a couple of burgers at Wendy's then stopped at a Shell station a block away to fill up. It was roughly 9:30pm Friday night. Outside the gas station was a drunk young man with a backpack and a skateboard, crying that he just wanted to go home. We managed to get out of him that he was out with friends who left him behind because he was too drunk (good friends) and he didn't know where he was. Clearly he was confused, and too out of it to use his phone, and was asking for help to get to a Skytrain station. We gave him a ride to the nearest station (Scott Road) that was on our route, and I gave him the meal I had bought for myself to hopefully help him sober up a bit. Hopefully reaching the familiar ground of the train station got him oriented enough to get home in his state. I wish we could have done more. Probably should have, but had a four-hour drive ahead of us and were already getting tired..

He said he was 24, had medium curly hair, medium skin (maybe mixed black-white, looked a lot like my kids, colour-wise) and was wearing a unique Betty Boop sportws-jersey-mesh type shirt (don't know what it's properly called).

Not asking for recognition or payback (we refused the $40 he offered for the ride), just want to know he's okay. But if he gets this message...my wife wants to know where you got that shirt, you are lucky she didn't steal it from you! 🤣",2020-05-09 23:01:27

"First Aid Awareness after saving a mans life yesterday, in Surrey.",28,bbo0k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/bbo0k1/first_aid_awareness_after_saving_a_mans_life/,6,1554942350.0,"Yesterday will always be in my memory. 

I had a slow morning and I was late for my doctors appointment, but I went with my gut and was okay with being late as they usually understand, I even turned back 5 minutes away from my house as I forgot my coffee (I am walking) 

So I end up getting to my bus stop on King George and Surrey Hospital (93rd I think?) as my doctors office is across the street, beside the Phoenix Rehab Center which is behind Dairy Queen. 

&#x200B;

I was walking down the sidewalk, it was 9:45  , and I heard a man coughing, I looked to my right and a man was sitting in his wheelchair out front of the rehab center, where people are usually sitting, but its just him and a girl who was starting to panic, so I called out and asked if he was okay.. 

There was another younger man sitting down who said ""hes as smoker hes fine"" but I had a feeling this was more than a smokers cough....

I walked up to him and realized after about 10 seconds he was choking, so here is where the lesson and awareness comes into play....

&#x200B;

I slightly panicked and ran inside and yelled for a nurse, I immediately ran back outside to him and he was now turning blue....so I again, ran back inside screaming at the top of my lungs for an ambulance, still no one was out yet as they had to get around their desks and just now realized I was being serious...

&#x200B;

So as I run back outside, the woman with the man screams at the top of her lungs ""hes dying"" 

he slumped forward and I ran up to him, bent down and looked up at his face and he was completely and 100% purple, almost beyond purple, it was now about 2 minutes since he started choking.... So I run around his chair and I instinctively (almost like the hands of an angel, and im not even religious) grab this mans body, and I start to do the Heimlich Maneuver....... I had to do this, with all of my strength for almost a minute. I will never forget the thoughts that were going through my head, it was over 3 minutes at this point and he wasn't moving. I thought I had a dead man in my arms.....and finally , as something in my head said to squeeze just half an inch higher, this giant piece of a muffin came flying out of this mans mouth, as he gurgled and gasps for air for the first time in minutes....

&#x200B;

I hear the security guard on my right scream ""hes alive!! hes making noise!!"" 

The ambulance ends up flying into the parking lot, two of them. They get out and the security guards, nurses and people all were basically in shock but we told them what had happened as they checked him, and they ended up telling me that without a doubt I had 100% saved this mans life, and that I am being ""nominated"" for some award. They took my information down and said I should be a paramedic. (if they only knew how much they have done for me in my life) and continuously thanked me, as the man came to and the girl calmed down, I learned he was 70 years old and he accepted and thought that was his time, that he was going to die....

&#x200B;

The Heimlich Maneuver saved this mans life, as well as staying calm and in the moment. 

&#x200B;

Yes I panicked at first, but I smartened up and it ended up being the major difference in this case.

&#x200B;

I am not posting this for recognition, or anything like that. I am posting this for people to know and understand that your help can change everything, that we are all here for a reason, and to help your fellow human no matter who and where it is. 

&#x200B;

This changed my life, but for the positive.....and I really needed that. 

&#x200B;

Compassion is everything, but so is knowledge of First Aid.

&#x200B;

I felt something strange at that point he suddenly came to that I will never forget, I have been through a lot in my 27 years on this earth, all story worthy, but this was just something different.... It was a miraculous moment, but it was also quite simply First Aid coming into play for the better. 

Although If I was not walking past that place at that time, he would of 150% died, it was such a strange time, no body was anywhere in sight for minutes, which are crucial when someones airways are blocked....

&#x200B;

Surrey cult,24,dvylbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/dvylbs/surrey_cult/,19,1573709117.0,"had a weird experience back in 2016. 

an old friend of mine randomly reached out to me after not speaking for several years. he said that he was part of this organization that was focused on creating leaders, but never mentioned this organization's name. he wanted me to meet his mentor, so I did. his mentor seemed nice, and said that their organization had a seven or so step program to join. he asked if I had a passport, and asked me to go with him and my friend to the states to some convention.  he gave me my first assignment in the program to complete. 

my gut told me that this was a bad idea, so I stopped talking to both of them. 

a couple months into 2017, I was reading a book in Surrey Central Mall. A guy came up to me and we started chatting. he started talking about his mentor, leadership, and a lot of stuff that my friend and his mentor had mentioned. nothing came of this interaction. 

just today I mentioned this to a friend at uni, who said that she was also approached by someone in late 2016 at Central saying the same things, and the ""assignment"" we were given was the same (""if you had a billion dollars what would you do for yourself, for your friends/family, and for God?"").

has anyone had a similar experience? it all sounds like a cult to me",2019-11-13 21:25:17

Opinion: People were misguided by Skytrain in Surrey,24,a6lvvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/a6lvvs/opinion_people_were_misguided_by_skytrain_in/,45,1544960293.0,"To start off this is my opinion and I’m open to any discussion on this topic. Feel free to correct me if i am saying something false. 

I think many people got misguided with the skytrain in Surrey movement. LRT was originally designed to improve commutes WITHIN Surrey. It was meant to connect core areas together ( newton to guildford for example). This while still allowing an LRT line to Langley as-well. I personally believe the vision of the LRT was to better connect Surrey,  as Tom Gill had said, Surrey is larger  than Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby combined (well not exactly, according to google, few km smaller).  The point of the LRT was to avoid B line congestion as it’s only expected to increase (keep in mind, Surrey is expected to surpass Vancouver in terms of population by 2040ish). The other benefit of LRT was it was an great attraction for businesses and it would especially improve transportation for employees. Another thing LRT provided from the images anyways was a attractive street space.  

Now here is where I think people started getting mislead. When the idea of an skytrain was brought up, most people I think believed that it would run through the same routes that the LRT was. Because the chant of remove LRT and replace it with skytrain started. I think a lot of voters didn’t know that skytrain was only going to replace the Surrey to Langley route and nothing would happen within Surrey. 

I constantly hear people say Surrey will have better transportation with skytrain, however it’s transportation to Langley that is improving. Surrey is paying for something to benefit Langley, a city with a 25,000 population, if anything Langley should pitch in for the cost since this benefits them tremendously.  Surrey on the other hand has a population of 500,000. This skytrain is a benefit to Langley, but the billions are being paid for by Surrey. The transportation in Surrey sees no improvement. And I still believe a lot of people think skytrain is an replacement for the LRT route within Surrey. Little do some people know, it’s only to Langley and nothing else. 

 TLDR: Doug ran a misleading campaign IMO. Most people probably thought the 'switch' to skytrain would be on the  Guildford - Surrey central - Newton connection, but instead it's a totally different route.",2018-12-16 03:38:13

Worst place ever to buy furniture from here. ORDERED BEDROOM SUITE everything delivered is either damaged or scratched. When I try to contact the owner for this place, wasn't  answering the call for atleast 10-15 times so I had to call from different number and his reply was that my job is to get it deliver only. WORST PLACE TO BUY.... I WOULD RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY ANY THING FROM HERE.""

Dear friends,

&#x200B;

Do not buy here; worst in the world. The owner is a fraud. I ordered furniture for my new home in December 2015 and its May 2016; I am still to receive half of the furniture. When I call the owner, he says he has some personal problems thats why he cant deliver his promise. Are you serious?

&#x200B;

I am going to file a lawsuit tomorrow.""",2019-01-09 01:57:36

They are obsessed with cars and Nerf related toys. We recently moved into a house in Langley/Surrey from our apartment in hopes that they can play with their arsenal of Nerf guns. Still not enough space (doesnt help that we have a few more Nerfs under the tree this christmas (I bought em). Checked around town Langley/Surrey for any indoor Nerf related centers/games/arenas/ groups, couldn't find any. Airsoft and paintball is a no for our family as we are looking for something much more casual and not so hardcore.

\*\*\*Updated\*\*\*Thinking of targeting the 6 - 14 age group (can expand to older group with Nerf Rival series later). Looking to start out as a mobile party service by the hour in Surrey/Langley and also provide 24/hr rentals of Nerf blasters and bunkers for Nerf Tag battles. 

Mobile partys will include basic blasters (all marked with our ID), eye protection, set up, clean up, unlimited reload darts, various fun game modes with referee, inflatable barricades to hide behind, and BYOG enabled (no own darts to reduce altercations of who owns what).  Parents will will decide and handle venue, food, drinks on their own, and we just provide equipment and the FUN. I will have use of a waiver form and have some form of liability insurance.

&#x200B;

Would like to open a special multi-purpose sport arena in future offering Nerf and other battle-type sports games for family fun. (archery tag, dodgeball, sword and shield games, jungle-gym fort field playing area on each side for Nerf battles, and more)

Depending on the trends, will host special events at venues in the future (gynasiums, parkour parks, skate parks, jungle gyms). Activities like gun test events, build a custom Nerf modulus gun, shooting range, shield making, themed events like Fortnite or zombies, costume actors dressed as popular movie characters, Rival Nerf series Blasters for older age group, modded gun events to show custom work, and an epic all out Nerf wars in a stadium)

&#x200B;

Will need to keep costs low in beginning. Will be FB advertising on a strict budget. Planning first private party for friends and family to help generate awareness of services with use of gameplay videos/photos uploaded on social media. Seen some good use of [Groupons.ca](https://Groupons.ca), if anyone has experience with them, would love to hear.

&#x200B;

There exists a number of similar companies in Eastern Canada and the US. Hopefully I can find something fun and lasting for our community in Westcoast.

Our study involves one MEG session (up to 3 hours) and one MRI session (up to 1.5 hours). The sessions are typically scheduled in two different days. In addition, the parent of the participating child would fill up some questionnaires to have a behavioural assessment associated with the neuroimaging data.

I'll start with a few of my favourites.  
  
Pho Tam - located behind Safe way near 104 and King George. Fast service, great broth and the best spring rolls I've ever tried.  
  
Nahm Thai Bistro - located on the corner of 136 and 102. The chicken satay with their peanut sauce is awesome and same with their prawn hot and sour soup.  
  
Zen Sushi - located near 108th and 148th behind Jolly Mac's pub. My favourite place to go for rolls but unfortunately you can't get chicken teriyaki or other cooked goods there because of their small kitchen. Tempura is available though and their spicy tuna crunch roll is the bomb!  
  
Maki Yaki Sushi - 152 and 101. Great spot for dinner. I always get their teriyaki dinner boat which is like 14 bucks and comes with their house roll, chicken or beef teriyaki, tempura, spring rolls,miso soup, rice and a salad.  
  
Akasaka Sushi - 151 and 101. Great place for a date night as it is very nice inside and they have those rooms where you take your shoes off. A bit expensive but great food and they have some interesting house rolls.

It's been over a week or two of the first empty shelf day but still everything is missing.

Delta superstore is still missing regular Oldmill bread(,though they are pumping out their in-house bread which is cheaper but expires faster) and no toilet paper and rarely any big paper towels.

Everything else seems to be ok, shampoo/conditioner aisle looking very barebones.

Fresco also is pretty barebones, a lot of pantry items still missing, frozen sections been picked clean, also no toilet paper.

Walmart I don't even want to enter but I'm assuming they are also cleaned out.

Government reccomends having 2 week supplies but I feel like people are buying more than they should, in a time of crisis it's ok to starve a little, most people are overweight and they still want to eat the same amount they eat in a crisis.

Do people not understand in a true collapse you should ration out food. A jar of peanut butter can last a week per person if you ration it out.",2020-03-21 20:02:31

I live in Vancouver and I am considering buying an apartment in Whalley area. I have no idea what to expect.  I checked the property and It seems ok. The neighbourhood is pretty much family oriented.

Build a new King George Station on the Holland Park side and then extend the line down King George to 72nd changing all the bus stops into stations (maybe skipping 80th and 76th avenue). Wound't this make more sense and cost way less than creating a whole new line that would service the lower populated town of Fleetwood to Langley city.

I just moved here from living in Vancouver for 10 years, mostly in Mount Pleasant, Commercial Drive and the West End. My first impressions is that Surrey people are down to earth, lots of young people (teenagers, wow) and haven't encountered any dangerous crime/theft or anything that surrey is known for.  It's quiet here but also dark at night (I take transit and streets are darker than downtown).

I moved because it was cheaper to buy a place in Surrey Central than paying Downtown rent. But I'm wondering, what places do you hang out? recommend to grab coffee (that isnt Starbucks or Tims), are there local cute / independent shops? or are they mostly in New West?  There isn't a JJ Bean here but perhaps something equivalent? 

I'm also a 30 something millennial, and wondering where to meet new friends!  Are there like community centre sports clubs or something? running clubs?",2020-03-07 20:17:38

People feeling entitled to park on the sidewalks in Surrey?,15,b6frsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/b6frsh/people_feeling_entitled_to_park_on_the_sidewalks/,19,1553786576.0,"This post is a bit venty. Since moving to Surrey some months ago, I've noticed a lot of people who blatantly park on the sidewalk, taking advantage of the low curbs. For me particularly, I see this happening a lot on a sidewalk I walk on every day: 98, near where it meets with 132. Is this something I should be reporting? If so, who should I contact? I was on the fence about pursuing this until an interaction I had about 15 minutes ago.  


Tonight I decided to take a photo of a car parked partially obstructing the sidewalk on 98, while walking home from a late shift. I thought, might as well, just in case. I didn't notice there were people inside. Almost instantly, the man inside sprung out of the car and began asking me why I was taking a photo of his car, claiming he lived just in the house next to us (That house has a big driveway on 132 so it didn't make sense). He asked me if his car was parked, as if idling on the sidewalk were legal. (It was parked and turned off.)  


He was very defensive and unexpectedly aggressive. He told me to delete the photo. I declined and explained to him that he was parked on the sidewalk, and that's why I took a photo. According to him, I'm not allowed to take photos of his car while he and I are on his ""property"". He began to film me. I stated he is in a public area meant for people to walk on. He said, ""Ok, then walking!"" I raised my eyebrows and kept walking in the direction I was originally going. Safely, thankfully.  


Overall unpleasant twist to the end of my night. Judging by his reaction I'd say he knew he was doing wrong, and now I'd like to submit a report using the photo of his car specifically. He's not the only one, I've seen cars parked there in the middle of the day. The area is right by a school and children pass through there.

I've lived in East Van for 17 years and I'm looking to make the move to Surrey possibly.

I was checking out Guilford as an option but basically I want to be close to a safe skytrain, groceries, coffee shops, breweries/pubs, yoga, community centres are all great. It'd be nice to still have the option of going to Vancouver, having a couple beers and being able to get home safely on the skytrain.

4.KNOW IN WHICH DIRECTION YOU WOULD POINT YOUR WHEELS WHEN PARKING AT UPHILL OR DOWNHILL

5. BE CAREFUL AT SCHOOLZONES AND PARK/PLAYGROUND ZONES. LOOK AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE 30KPH SPEED LIMIT SIGN ON YOUR LEFT HAND SIDE (be careful at unwin park at 132 and 68a(?) if you'll turn right at the stop sign on that street, there's no 30KPH speed limit sign)

I have been interested in board games for a couple of years now, and have amassed a decent collection. I'm usually able to find a group of friends together maybe a couple times a month to play some games. I however want to play much more than that, and play a game more than once. I thought this might be a place to start to find other local people that are interested in doing some Saturday/Friday night gaming. I don't want to pay a fee for meetup, and all the meetup board game groups are operating out of stores, and are not local. 

If you are interested please PM me a way to add you on FB. I have created a group that will post the times I will be hosting the next game night (usually every week). 

Since it is out of my own house space is very limited, so it will be a first come first serve basis (I have a table that can comfortably hold 8). If you are rude, have poor hygiene, or being unrespectful to my property you will be removed from the group.

Who I'm voting for,12,9p5u1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/9p5u1t/who_im_voting_for/,20,1539864607.0,"I'm voting **Pauline Greaves** for mayor. ""*For the many not the few*"" says it all. We need to take power back from established forces who use a combination of fear-mongering and grandiose promises to placate us when all they actually care about is lining their own pockets and helping out their rich buddies. 

Pauline hasn't been treated as a top candidate. There was no reason for her to be excluded from the mayoral debate on October 9 (CBC invited her, then later uninvited her for bullshit reasons). So here's me encouraging you to look into her platform and give her your support.

For council, I don't want to vote for a ""set"" of candidates without giving every candidate a chance, so I read every one of these profiles to narrow down who I like: [https://www.surrey.ca/election/candidates/candidates-for-councillor.aspx](https://www.surrey.ca/election/candidates/candidates-for-councillor.aspx).

I have to say I am pretty disappointed in the lack of information the vast majority of these candidates have provided in their profiles. A lot of them sound more like resumes or networking pitches than reasons why I should vote for them. I don't *care* how many years you've been a lawyer/real estate agent/small business owner, I don't *care* about your degrees or your memberships! All I want to know is what you value and what you support. So many of these candidates provided zero information about what they actually stand for. It was even more abysmal when it came to the school trustees' profiles.

Here are four candidates running for council who will have my vote on Saturday:

1. **Stuart Parker** (This dude is dope. He's my top fave.)
2. **Steven Pettigrew** (I had the pleasure of meeting this man and I must say he REALLY CARES about the people of Surrey. This is a man with passion and a real conscience, who will truly listen to you. He has my vote.)
3. **Allison Patton** (I have an environmental illness. What she says about understanding the root causes of the symptoms she sees in her patients really sold me on her.)
4. **Bernie Sheppard** (I have had the pleasure of speaking with him a few times. He is a creative and forward-thinking individual.)

Let me know who you are voting for and why!

From 1910 to 1954 a commuter train ran from Chilliwack to New Westminster. The rail lines still exist, just waiting for a new plan!

The Valley Transportation Advisory Committee (VALTAC) thinks they have one. Hear about reactivating the Interurban Corridor with a state-of-the-art Passenger Rail Service to run from the Pattullo Bridge to Chilliwack connecting 13 communities, 14 Post Secondary Institutions, the Abbotsford International Airport and much more.

A highlight for Surrey is it’s unique interconnection with Newton and doesn’t threaten the Green Timbers Urban Forest with extra widening.

For the past months, several expenditures have occurred such as red/green lights - 1.7K+taxes, mats for elevators - 1.7K, and 17 speed bumps - up to 17K (from contingency reserve fund). 

Honestly, I don't know if all the spendings are justifiable. Are traffic lights and mats necessary? They sure do make the parkade and elevators look good, but what else?

I get that speed bumps are for the safety of the residents, but 17 bumps seem a bit excessive. While the bylaw requires the strata council to hold a special meeting on expenditure over 2K, the council referred to the emergency/safety concern exemption to bypass the bylaw (which I think they are just twisting the wordings. Not having 17 speed bumps will not have an immediate danger to the residents). If speeding really is a concern for the residents, why not just follow the bylaw and let's have a vote on the spending?

Plus, heard that 200+ warnings were issued in a month or so for minor bylaw infractions (i.e. Improper disposal of garbage and not waiting till the garage gate fully closes etc.) through the use of surveillance cameras - which I am sure violates the laws under PIPA. I shouldn't feel like I am being policed at home!
